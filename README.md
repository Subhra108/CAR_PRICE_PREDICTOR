# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the price of cars based on various features like model, age, mileage, and other specifications. Using machine learning techniques, the goal is to create a reliable model that helps estimate car prices accurately, providing value for dealerships and individual sellers.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes key attributes of cars that influence their prices. Common features in such datasets are:
- *Car Make and Model*: Brand and type of vehicle.
- *Year of Manufacture*: Vehicle's age.
- *Mileage*: Distance covered by the car.
- *Fuel Type*: Diesel, petrol,CNG electric, or hybrid.
- *Transmission Type*: Manual or automatic gearbox.

## Features
- *Data Preprocessing*: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables such as car make and fuel type.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis*: Using visualizations to explore trends,and distributions of car prices.
- *Model Development*: Training algorithms like Linear Regression and Lasso Regression for predicting car prices.
- *Evaluation Metrics*: Utilizing R-squared and Mean Absolute Error(MAE) to validate predictions.

## Results
The project demonstrates a high correlation between predicted car prices and actual market values. It identifies key factors such as mileage and car age as critical contributors to price prediction.

## Tools & Libraries
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib and seaborn.

## Future Scope
- Expansion of the dataset with additional car attributes to enhance predictions.
- Deployment of the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-world usability.
- Application of deep learning techniques for more nuanced predictions.
